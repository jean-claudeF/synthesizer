Synthesizer experiments
A very long time ago, I built an analog synthesizer.
This old passion is revived by the technical possibilities of today.


Especially this: I more or less stumbled over Zynthian:
https://zynthian.org/
A platform that contains multiple synthesizers, runs on a Raspi and is Open Source. Phantastic!


I started with nearly no hardware:

The result was very encouraging, so I wanted to go on and add some controls like encoders and buttons.
This took me a long time, but it could have been much easier if I had known what I know today.
My errings are described here:
